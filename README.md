# 🔐 Cryptographic Protocol for Legal Document Exchange

This project simulates a secure cryptographic protocol for exchanging legal contracts between parties. It combines RSA for key exchange, AES for encryption, and ECDSA for digital signatures to ensure confidentiality, authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation.
